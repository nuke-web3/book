# An Important Point

### _Make it clear_ <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:

Stuff you should remember to say

---

## Some Image

<img rounded style="width: 60%;" src="./img/REMOVE-ME-example-img.png" />

<!--
Always place images and other media assets into `./img/`.
If you want to reuse and image, please `ln -s <some other img path>` to include a soft link in the `./img/` dir for these slides.
-->

Notes:

<!--
Always always _always_ include the source you got any image from in the speaker notes for the first slide it is used in, and be sure to include explicitly what it's license is known to be.
-->

Image source: (some URL here!)
License: (some URL, annotated with the know license of this img. Eg: `[CC BY-NC 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/)` - if unknown please mark `UNKNOWN` here)

---

## Some Shared Image

<img rounded style="width: 30%;" src="../copy-paste-slides/img/makeitmove.gif" />

1. Dos
1. Tres

</nuke-flex>

Notes:

Make sure to include things here to say to audiences, perhaps a hint or two.

<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#4A2439" -->

# Questions

<!--
Always plan on some time for Q&A ðŸ˜€
-->

---

## Next Steps

<!--
Compile a list of:
- topics not covered here but audiences should consider learning about independently
- examples of the concepts covered in this topic applied to a project, to case-study
- useful resources related to the topic

- Reference other slides/materials by relative directory in this repo, like the [copy-paste slide templates](../content-templates/slides/copy-paste-reveal-template-slides.md)
-->

<nuke-flex center>

1. Eins
1. Zwei
1. Drei

</nuke-flex>

---

## References

<!--
Compile an **annotated** list of URLs to source material referenced in making these topics.
Ideally this is exhaustive, it can be cleaned up before delivery to audiences, but must include _why_ a reference is used.
For example:

- [ss58-registry](https://github.com/paritytech/ss58-registry) - A list of known SS58 account types as an enum, typically used by the Polkadot, Kusama or Substrate ecosystems.
- [wiki on parathreads](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-parathreads) - A description of the parathread model.
