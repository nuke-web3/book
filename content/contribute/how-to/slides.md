## How to use Reveal.js Features

Try doing down a slide.

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

### Use the keybindings!

- **Overview mode**: “O” to see a birds-eye view of your presentation, “ESC” to return to the highlighted slide (you can quickly navigate with arrows)

- **Full-screen**: “F”, “ESC” to exit full-screen mode

- **Speaker mode**: “S” it synchronizes 2 windows: one with the presentation, and another with a timer and all speaker notes!

- **Zoom-in**: ALT+click make the view zoom at the position of your mouse’s pointer; very useful to look closely at a picture or chart surrounded by too much bullet points.

## Speaker Notes & Viewer

_Press the `s` key to bring up a popup window with speaker view_

**You need to unblock popups to have the window open**

Notes:
This is a note just for you. Set under a line in your slide starting with "`Note`:" all
subsequent lines are just seen in speaker view.
