## Why RISC Zero?

### _Write Rust ü¶Ä<br/> Not Circuits ùõå_

Notes:

### Story time!

Started in self-sovereign tech rabbit whole 2018 ETHDenver.
Mesh networks, local first, DAOs and co-ops, token engineering...
Then I found out about ZKPs and what they can do to fundamentally change the game and enable things that were impossible before.
As an fanboi of the ZK Podcast for years, I wanted so much to get in... but there was a problem: learning curve on cryptography.
I want to build cryptographic systems, but not need to deeply understand the moon math...
Enter zkVMs: RISC Zero.
Now we can all make ZKPs with only a strong conceptual grasp of constraint systems and Rust (more languages to come!)

## Why RISC Zero?

- **Verifiable Computation**: outsource-able
- **Highly Scalable**: low-cost verification
- **Tunable Privacy**: robust & universal\*

Notes:

- you can verify that a computation of a specific program ran exactly as it should, even if done by untrusted executor!
- _Prover_ that runs program & produces _receipt_ reveals as little as nothing to everything about execution to _verifier_.
- Verification is significantly cheaper than running computation yourself... at the cost of prover doing significantly more work to run the _zkVM_
- \* Privacy is from everyone outside the prover, if you are the prover, no one but you has secret data.

## What key web3 problems can ZK address?

<nuke-cols>
<nuke-col center>

### EVM Devs

- **Referring to historical state**
- **Trusting off-chain logic**
- **Boundless Execution**

</nuke-col>
<nuke-col center>

### Layer <0|1|2|...> Devs

- **True ZK (Privacy)**
- **Scalability (Compression)**
- **Interoperability (üåâ, rollups)**

> See RISC Zero <a target="_blank" href="https://dev.risczero.com/api/use-cases">docs</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://risczero.com/blog">blog</a> for **lots** more

Notes:

- RETH / REVM -> ZETH - support EVM execution of contracts, REVM for only parts.
  - Also supports verifiable merkle proof of subset of global evm state.
- **ZK coprocessor** - run verifiable program logic in zkVM by 3rd party or yourself to untrusting parties
- Added **security** and **fairness** and **privacy** that zero knowledge proofs can provide, as they involve complex decision-making and competitive interactions.
- Privacy is optional, fully transparent games with ZKPs _can_ provided added guarantees around many things other than that (if carefully designed)

# ‚ú® Inspiration

##### ‚ö†Ô∏è -- Do not copy üçù -- üôè

Notes:

Plagiarism, missing attribution and violating licenses will disqualify you!
Building on them to something significantly enhancements _**may**_ be considered - please let us know what you are planning :grin:

Notes:

- Winner of RISC Zero Coprocessor Bounty at ETHDenver 2024 and did well in community quadratic voting too!
- Idea: take it further and make a bevy app in wasm w/ webGPU with **shared core logic identical on web & "re-player" zkVM**

Notes:

Want to build even more complicated or otherwise impossible contract logic?
Enter Steel - view call library.
Example: view call that checks existence of balance on chain, like in our ERC20 example workshop!

## üéá What is special about RISC Zero? (1)

- Developer productivity (@ hackathons & beyond)
  <br/>&nbsp; Top 1000 <a target="_blank" href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a> tested nightly,
  <br/>&nbsp; benchmarks and more: <a target="_blank" href="https://reports.risczero.com/">reports.risczero.com</a>
- Hard in zkDSL, easy in zkVM:
  <br/>&nbsp; Loops & branching
  <br/>&nbsp; Design ü°∫ Implementation ü°∫ Auditing

Notes:

- Lots of ZKP options, why use R0?
  - zkDSL _could_ be more performant, but time to market is very high, small set of humans can implement them at all.
  - Why use us over other zkVMs?
    First, arguably best devex, v1.0 release stability and prover performance milestones!

---

## üéá What is special about RISC Zero? (2)

- Proof <a target="_blank" href="https://www.risczero.com/blog/continuations">continuation</a>
  <br/>&nbsp; Unbounded guest programs
- Proof <a target="_blank" href="https://www.risczero.com/blog/proof-composition">composition</a>
  <br/>&nbsp; "Proof-ception"
  <br/>&nbsp; Hybrid Client side {üïµÔ∏èprivacy} & server {ü¶æpower}
- Execution _separate_ from proof generation

Notes:

- Proof-ception = efficient verification of proofs within a guest.
  - Privacy for small client side proofs and the bulk of proof computational overhead outsourced to an untrusted prover.
  - Reuse of existing proofs included in new proof using their journal
  - Batching/compression of many proofs
  - Proof transposition for compatibility of specific verifiers.
- Execution is near zero overhead, proving is high overhead.
  - Realtime exec & prove in parallel / after / remote is possible
- What killer features does R0 provide?

## üéá What is special about RISC Zero? (3)

**‚õìÔ∏è EVM Support ‚õìÔ∏è**

- <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/risc0/risc0-foundry-template">RISC Zero Foundry template</a>
  <br/>&nbsp; Write unbounded programs for EVM chains
- <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/risc0/risc0-ethereum">Ethereum contracts, proof systems, and more</a>
  <br/>&nbsp; View call proofs with **Steel**
  <br/>&nbsp; ZK Rollups & RollApps
  <br/>&nbsp; ... Help us define more!

Notes:

- Zeth _could_ run existing solidity games off chain, optionally unbounded computation per block (gasless). [Zeth deep dive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pBmf839eOA)
- mention: 256 view call limit - could you do inclusion proof checkpoints? contract state is simply recursive proof of minimal thing needed (maybe block header / hash?) updated by anyone to use for deep archival view calls? prove "this state was in block X that is a child of recent block {younger than 256}"

---

## ü§ø Before you dive deep...

- You _must_ match versions of `cargo risczero` and your Cargo.toml deps
  <br/>&nbsp; Some examples / templates may not be the version you need!
  <br/>&nbsp; Use `^1.0` versions throughout.
- Keep guest minimal - extra cycles are _**expensive**_
  <br/>&nbsp; ...But this is a hackathon, don't stress too much!
- When experimenting, always use <a target="_blank" href="https://dev.risczero.com/api/generating-proofs/dev-mode"> `DEV_MODE`</a>!
  <br/>&nbsp; Execution _only_ with mocked proving (fast!)
- Bonsai API key priority & support
  <br/>&nbsp; Apply: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bonsai.xyz/">bonsai.xyz/</a> (manual review & approval from our team)
- Discord `#üíª|support-forum` channel for help
  <br/>&nbsp; Join: <a target="_blank" href="https://discord.com/invite/risczero">discord.gg/risczero</a>

> üß† Don't need to know the crypto details to build...<br/> don't forget you are building a cryptographic system!
