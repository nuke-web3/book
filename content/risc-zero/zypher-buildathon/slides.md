## Why RISC Zero?

- **Verifiable Computation**: outsource-able
- **Highly Scalable**: low-cost verification
- **Tunable Privacy**: robust & universal\*

Notes:

- you can verify that a computation of a specific program ran exactly as it should, even if done by untrusted executor!
- _Prover_ that runs program & produces _receipt_ reveals as little as nothing to everything about execution to _verifier_.
- Verification is significantly cheaper than running computation yourself... at the cost of prover doing significantly more work to run the _zkVM_
- \* Privacy is from everyone outside the prover, if you are the prover, no one but you has secret data.

## What problems can ZK address for games?

<nuke-cols>
<nuke-col center>

### On-chain & Web3

- calldata limits restrict complexity
- prohibitive gas costs
- most blockchains lack privacy

</nuke-col>
<nuke-col center>

### Off-chain & Web2

- Cheating through manipulation of official game logic
- Private game aspects without any 3rd party / admin to adjudicate

Notes:

- **ZK coprocessor** - run verifiable program logic in zkVM by 3rd party or yourself to untrusting parties
- Added **security** and **fairness** and **privacy** that zero-knowledge proofs can provide, as they involve complex decision-making and competitive interactions.
- Commonly turn based, but can simply be tick based (STF analogy -> blocks)
- Privacy is optional, fully transparent games with ZKPs _can_ provided added guarantees around many things other than that (if carefully designed)
  - cheating specifically in being able to go around rules of game logic, especially in cases with hidden player data/logic. (Don't trust. verify!)
- Private:
  - moves of known players
  - cards in your hand / hidden from all deck shuffle
  - hidden ID / anonymous interactions in multiplayer
  - Enabling incomplete information games (e.g. ‚Äúfog of war‚Äù mechanics)
- Can prove final score without revealing _anything_ about the game that resulted in it! Proof of Exploit CTF.

- Off-chain: CFT game where you prove you got a flag without revealing it (because that needs to remain secret) no 3rd party to check, use a proof!

## RISC Zero Track Objective

> Develop games using RISC Zero to ensure **privacy and fairness**.

Notes:

Developers are encouraged to implement game designs that can verify player actions without disclosing specific game data. This approach allows for the exploration of new gaming models that operate off-chain but utilize on-chain verification to ensure transparency and fairness.

Notes:

- deeper understanding as exercise for views of this presentation.
- very happy to answer questions on our discord!

## RISC Zero On-chain

> Read about <a target="_blank" href="https://dev.risczero.com/api/blockchain-integration/bonsai-on-eth">Blockchain Integration</a> and watch the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcPzhUaCxlCgsTtFen4oxFIDkUMSVSFFo">Foundry Template playlist</a>.

Notes:

- TODO diagram how the proof works in game context (seq. diagrams with actors IDed (player, execution, prover))

# ‚ú® Inspiration

##### ‚ö†Ô∏è -- Do not copy üçù -- üôè

Notes:

Plagiarism, missing attribution and violating licenses will disqualify you!
Building on them to something significantly enhancements _**may**_ be considered - please let us know what you are planning :grin:

## ZK Checkmate Demo

<!-- FIXME link that works in book and slides and gh-pages -->

Join in following the [Hands-on instructions ‚ÜóÔ∏è](./workshop.md)

Notes:

- See the recording there to follow along for an overview.
- I encourage you to experiment yourself!

## <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/risc0/risc0/tree/v1.0.1/examples/bevy">Bevy (R0 v1.0.1)</a>

- **Serious** Rust <a target="_blank" href="https://bevyengine.org/">game engine</a>
- Great base to start hackin' ü§†
- Start with shared `core` logic

Notes:

- Core logic can be used in the host & the guest for Bevy games
- Design guest to be _minimal_ as proofs are costly!

Notes:

- Winner of RISC Zero Coprocessor Bounty at ETHDenver 2024 and did well in community quadratic voting too!
- Idea: take it further and make a bevy app in wasm w/ webGPU with **shared core logic identical on web & "re-player" zkVM**

## ü§î What is special about RISC Zero?

- developer productivity (@ hackathons & beyond)
  - Top 1000 [crates.io](https://crates.io/) tested ~nightly: [reports.risczero.com](https://reports.risczero.com/)
- todo: key features that are HARD in zkDSL
- proof continuation
- execution separate from proof (realtime exec & prove in parallel / after / remote)
- foundry template & steel & mainnet verifiers

Notes:

- lots of ZKP option, why use R0?
- What killer features does R0 provide?

- Not exclusive on ZKP world for these in many cases longer term, but the collection of them together today makes it very compelling!

- Zeth _could_ run existing solidity games off chain, optionally unbounded computation per block (gasless). [Zeth deep dive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pBmf839eOA)
- NOTE: 256 view call limit - could you do inclusion proof checkpoints? contract state is simply recursive proof of minimal thing needed (maybe block header / hash?) updated by anyone to use for deep archival view calls? prove "this state was in block X that is a child of recent block {younger than 256}"

---

## üé® ZK Game Design Patterns

- Prove transcript of game for verifiable high scores
- Prove state update based on complex game logic
- Prove validity of player moves while concealing
- play & prove latter (snake game)
- proof for each hidden move, perhaps in a tx on chain
- can run only core game logic in zkVM - GUI and other non-security/privacy/fairness aspects can live outside the proven core logic (diagram)
- randomness
  - cannot do within guest - only fake & deterministic random for replay of moves perhaps (who gets to know seed? Choose? VRF maybe?)

---

## üìù Key Takeaways

- as a game dev: what does zk do and not do for me?
- IMPORTANT: match version of `cargo risczero` & examples / templates / examples
- keep guest minimal - extra cycles are VERY expensive (but this is a hackathon, don't over optimize)
- USE DEV MODE!
- Bonsai API key priority & support
- you are designing a cryptographic system, not just a game
- Support forum on discord for help!
- dedicated channel for this event?
- TODO more
