### ‚≠ê Zypher ü§ù RISC Zero Example

<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/zypher-game/poker0">poker0</a> - A poker game leveraging RISC Zero and PLONK for off-chain proof of game processes, with on-chain validation, built on the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/zypher-game/z4">Z4 engine</a>.

> Note: This perhaps is a rather complex starting point from without any experience with RISC Zero or PLONK, we suggest experimenting with the [more basic examples](#risc-zero-game-examples) first to get a feel for things first üò∏.

### RISC Zero Game Examples

Note that many other <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/risc0/risc0/tree/release-0.21/examples/">examples</a> showcase things you might want (reading a JSON file, checking a password, and more!)

Here are a few key game specific ones:

- <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/risc0/risc0/tree/release-0.21/examples/bevy">Bevy</a> - a serious Rust game engine
- <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/risc0/risc0/tree/release-0.21/examples/wordl">Wordl</a> - A non-trivial game
- <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/risc0/risc0/tree/release-0.21/examples/chess">Chess</a>
- <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/risc0/risc0/tree/release-0.21/examples/composition">Bevy</a>

- Winner of RISC Zero Coprocessor Bounty at ETHDenver 2024 and did well in community quadratic voting too!
- Idea: take it further and make a bevy app in wasm w/ webGPU with **shared core logic identical on web & "re-player" zkVM**

‚òùÔ∏è A fantastic veteran review of their work and showcases fundamentally new type of game that web3 makes possible: build base infrastructure for others **to build on top of _permissionless_**.
Shared infra -> plurality of ways to interact with a wider community on the same base layer opens up novel MMO games _**built by and for players**_!

Although today zkVMs help devs avoid needing to write most of the game in some contract language or (zk)DSL, like is enabled in RISC Zero with <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/risc0/risc0/tree/release-0.21/examples/bevy">the bevy game engine</a>.
And it's very likely to be far more cost effective to run too!
